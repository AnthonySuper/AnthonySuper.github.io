The internet has recently been in a mild panic about advertising.
Specifically, it is freaking out about the rise of software that can block advertisements.
Over half of people my age use an ad blocker [source](http://www.cjr.org/analysis/reuters_digital_news_report.php), and that number is steadily increasing.

I can see why large swaths of the internet is afraid. 
Ads are the main revenue source for an extremely large number of websites, and the rise of ad blockers has the potential to kill off a large portion of the internet as we know it.
The age of free content, it seems, may be coming to an end.

Unless, of course, we can stop it.
But, before we do that, let's take a quick look at what the timeline is going to be like.
