I've been using this web page for my [CS192](http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs192/.Fall15/) class at Colorado State University.
As part of one of the assignments, I have to use a table.
So there's a table after the break.

What, that's not enough?

Fine.

<table class="full-table">
<tr>
  <th>Interest</th>
  <th>Amount of Interest</th>
  <th>Time taken</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Web Development</td>
  <td>A lot</td>
  <td>Also a lot</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Music</td>
  <td>A lot</td>
  <td>Not as much</td>
<tr>
<tr>
  <td>Game Development</td>
  <td>A fair amount</td>
  <td>Next to zero</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Physics</td>
  <td>Not high</td>
  <td>A lotâ€”my physics class is hard</td>
</tr>

</table>
